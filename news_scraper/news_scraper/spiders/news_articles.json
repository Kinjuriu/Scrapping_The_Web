He also seems to have a pretty bad heroin habit, but he keeps that to himself at night.

And it was not supposed to be a risky outing considering it was well before monsoon season when they went exploring after practice. But the rains came early and trapped the young boys and their coach. For days, no one even knew whether they were alive and Thai Navy SEALS were neither trained nor properly equipped to do this kind of cave diving. The situation became more dire with each passing day. ", "It turns out cave diving is not something any elite emergency team in the world has trained for.

There are so many compelling characters helping to tell this story, but the two Brits, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, are almost too good to be true\u2014 wry, unassuming and a little wounded still from their early years when they were not successful in team sports.

Kranz\u2019s film, the veteran actor\u2019s first as writer-director, is about two sets of parents who meet, cautiously and with still raw wounds, to talk six years after a school shooting that brought their families together. ", "Gail (Martha Plimpton) and Jay (Jason Isaacs) lost their son in an attack by the son of Richard (Reed Birney) and Linda (Ann Dowd, ), who also died that day. Their meeting, in a nondescript church across from a broad field and snow-dusted mountains, makes up the entire film, one built around an intensely emotional dialogue of grief, regret and maybe catharsis, as performed brilliantly by a quartet of actors. ", "We don\u2019t immediately know the reason for the get-together. Kranz, whose film feels meant for the stage, begins with the anxious table-setting at the church, an Episcopalian chapel. A church volunteer (Breeda Wool, also excellent) makes nervous preparations with a mediator (Michelle N. Carter) who arrives in advance for a meeting that\u2019s never specified, as if it\u2019s too sensitive to even voice. In its restrained way, \u201cMass\u201d makes an argument for carefully creating \u201ca space,\u201d literally and figuratively, for speaking about the unspeakable,", "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do it,\u201d Gail tells her husband as they arrive. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know if I can say it.\u201d", "Once they\u2019re all seated, the talk is initially timid and polite. For us, the sense that we\u2019re slowly moving closer to an iceberg of grief only grows. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve met but, as we gather in small allusions, they\u2019ve been through years of public debate. Lawsuits, not between them but from other families of victims, have limited what Richard \u2014 a clinical analyzer of the situation, the only one in a business suit \u2014 and Linda \u2014 a soulful, soft-spoken woman with sensitive, sad eyes \u2014 have previously been able to say. She and Gail have written each other before. But slowly the pitch rises. ", "\u201cTell me about your son?\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cBecause he killed my son.\u201d", "The anguished dialogue flows remarkably naturally, even as all struggle to articulate their feelings. Jay and Gail fight to hold down their rage. The fraught conversation sometimes slides into familiar debate points about guns , videogames and mental health, but it mostly steers toward grasping at some understanding. Why did he do it? Could they have done better as parents? Is the loss of one couple greater than the other? Is forgiveness possible? How can they make any sense of it? ", "\u201cThe love we had, it was real. And the truth is, we believed we were good parents, and in some awful, confusing way, we still do,\u201d says Linda. \u201cIs it worse that I thought I was a good mother?\u201d ", "None of this may be anyone\u2019s idea of a happy movie night. But in scratching at real wisdom, \u201cMass,\u201d which begins playing in theaters Friday, is stirring in its humanity. Kranz\u2019s film isn\u2019t perfect. As the conversation ebbs and the four parents stagger out of the room and awkwardly part, the movie, too, struggles with how to walk away. But in this plainly photographed, mournful, restrained movie, the back-and-forth is bracingly sincere. ", "Each actor deserves praise but Plimpton, as a hardened woman trying to unburden herself of her sorrow without at the same time losing a piece of her son, is magnificent. Dowd\u2019s performance, too, is so richly empathetic; Linda\u2019s melancholy is bottomless but there\u2019s something spiritual in how eager she is to ease Jay and Gail\u2019s suffering, if she can. The performances are too internalized to seem theatrical. Often, \u201cMass\u201d is most moving when they\u2019re simply listening.

The movie, written by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener, is not the tale of manly valor that it first appears. \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d is more like a medieval tale deconstructed, piece by piece, until its heavily armored male characters and the genre\u2019s mythologized nobility are unmasked.", "The film, framed like \u201cRashomon,\u201d is told in three chapters repeated from different perspectives. The first, which belongs to Jean de Carrouges (Damon), might have once been the sole version of \u201cThe Last Duel.\u201d In 14th century France, de Carrouges is a loyal and valiant soldier for King Charles VI (a childish ruler played by Alex Lawther) who weds a nobleman\u2019s daughter, Marguerite (Jodie Comer). He finds his agreed upon dowry, including a handsome parcel of Normandy, has been taken instead as a debt collection by the Count Pierre d\u2019Alen\u00e7on (Affleck). He in turn awards the land to de Carrouges\u2019 friend and fellow warrior Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver), infuriating de Carrouges. This starts a rift between de Carrouges and Le Gris, as well as with the count, who strongly favors Le Gris. De Carrouges sees himself as a good and brave man, unfairly treated by his superiors. When he returns from a trip, his wife informs him that she was raped by Le Gris while he was away. De Carrouges vows to bring him to justice.", "There are hints in even this straightforward first section of something not quite lining up. Firstly, there are those haircuts. Damon sports a mullet and a half-formed beard that seems hardly fashionable in any century, while Affleck has trim blond locks that would be better suited to a boy band. That they look a little foolish may be intentional.", "The second section replays the same time period only as according to Le Gris, and \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d grows more interesting. Here, we see De Carrouges as an impetuous soldier, an aggrieved complainer and, well, no fun. He fusses and fumes about honor while Le Gris and the count (Affleck in campy splendor) roll their eyes and spend late nights drinking and bedding women. To Le Gris, his act with Marguerite is bold and rough but driven by love, and perhaps mutual longing \u2014 though certainly not consensual.", "Damon and Affleck, who last together scripted their breakout, \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d have said they wrote the first two sections, and handed over the third, of Marguerite\u2019s account, to Holofcener, the filmmaker of \u201cEnough Said\u201d and \u201cLovely and Amazing.\u201d The film, adapted from Eric Jager\u2019s 2004 non-fiction book about the true history, has naturally been building to this definitive account.", "But it\u2019s not just the conclusion to a he-said-she-said drama. The third section is a wholly different perspective on the Middle Ages, as typically seen in film. Comer takes control of the film as it captures Marguerite\u2019s experience being wed in a business transaction, the pressure to birth an heir (something that can only happen, she\u2019s told, if she also finds pleasure in sex with her husband) and her savvy stewardship of the castle while De Carrouges is away.", "Here, \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d seems not at all so long ago, at all. Many of the dueling perspectives of the film \u2014 slyly self-aware \u2014 reverberate with today\u2019s #MeToo struggles. It\u2019s tempting to think \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d should have just been Marguerite\u2019s account, but so much of the film\u2019s pleasure is seeing Damon, Affleck and Driver \u2014 each playing a type, a sort of guy \u2014 gradually dismantle and even lampoon their own charms.", "\u201cThe Last Duel,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for strong violence including sexual assault, sexual content, some graphic nudity, and language.
